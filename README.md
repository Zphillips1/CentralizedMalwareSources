# Consolidated Malware Site list
A Consolidated List of malware-based news sites,samples, articles, journals, etc. 
First off the definition of malware, for those unaware:  is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network (by contrast, software that causes unintentional harm due to some deficiency is typically described as software bug). A wide variety of malware types exist, including computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wiper, and scareware.

# Types of Malware
Viruses - Requires execution for it to spread, unlike a worm. Will modify other programs and insert its code and spread that way.

Worms - Replicates itself to spread to other networked devices.

Trojans -  Malicious software that pretends to be something it isn't.

Ransomware - blocks access to data, or publishes the data unless the ransom the threat actor asks for is "paid".

Spyware - Spies on an organization or individual to gather information on them.

Adware - Malicious software that generates revenue through ad generation, through an installer, or a site.

Wiper - Malware with the sole intent to wipe out the contents on the drive it is on.

Scareware - Malicious software with the intent for someone to download something unnecessary, when in fact there was no infection at all.
